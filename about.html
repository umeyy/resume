            <h1>🌷 About Me – Beyond the First Glance</h1>
            <p>Hey, I’m <span class="highlight">Habiba M. Fazil</span> — a third-year Software Engineering student, a girl from Matiari, and someone whose strength is rooted not just in code, but in silent resilience, love, and dreams far bigger than herself.</p>
            <p>If you’ve made it here, welcome to the most personal page on this site — not just what I do, but who I am.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>🌿 Where I Come From</h2>
            <p>I grew up in a small city called <span class="highlight">Matiari</span>, raised by the strongest woman I know — my mom.</p>
            <p>My father passed away before I was even born. Since then, it’s always been just the two of us. My mother has been my world: my strength, my softness, my love, my everything. Every line of code I write, every goal I chase, every late-night dream — it’s all for her.</p>
            <p>She supported me emotionally.<br>I supported us financially.<br>I'm proud to say: I’ve earned every step of my journey.</p>

            <h2>💡 My Shift – From Silence to Spark</h2>
            <p>I wasn’t always like this. Once extroverted, I now live somewhere between quiet and expressive — an ambivert with a deep mind and a soft heart.</p>
            <p>Some days I’m full of energy and laughter. Other days, I’m just the quiet girl again — headphones in, avoiding noise, floating in thoughts. Mood defines me. Music grounds me.</p>
            <p>I’m also deeply private. Most people don't know what I carry, or what I’ve been through. But if you follow my work… or my social media… you might just see it.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>🎓 My Journey in Education</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Bachelor's in Software Engineering</li>
                <li>Currently in 3rd Year – <span class="highlight">[university of sindh]</span></li>
                <li>Expected Graduation: <span class="highlight">[3rd Year]</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>From day one, no one bore the cost of my education but me.</p>
            <p>I earn, I study, I build — all by myself.</p>
            <p><strong>My daily routine:</strong><br>
                📚 7 AM – University<br>
                🏃‍♀️ 3 PM – Tuition classes as a student<br>
                👩‍🏫 5–7 PM – Teaching to earn my expenses<br>
                🌙 7 PM onward – Home, food, sleep, repeat.
            </p>
            <p>And in between? I dream. I listen to music. I build quiet empires in my mind.</p>

            <h2>✨ My Inspiration & Purpose</h2>
            <p>One evening, watching a series, I saw a man begging for help — no one reached in time. The police came after it was over. That scene haunted me.</p>
            <p>It birthed a secret mission inside me:<br><span class="highlight">To build an emergency alert app</span> — something that could help people before it’s too late.</p>
            <p>It’s not built yet. But it's alive in me.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>💻 What I Love to Build</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Websites and apps with big purposes, with meaningfull uses</li>
                <li>Designs with feminine grace and professional elegance</li>
                <li>AI, games, and tools that make people feel safe, seen, and strong</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>💃 Lost but Not Forgotten: My Hobby</h2>
            <p>One of my deepest passions has always been <span class="highlight">dancing</span> — a form of expression I had to let go of to prioritize my studies and responsibilities.</p>
            <p>But it still lives in my heart — maybe one day, I’ll dance again when life feels a bit lighter.</p>

            <h2>💭 Dreams After Graduation</h2>
            <p>More than anything, I want to give my mother a peaceful life.<br>Buy her a home. Get her a car. Let her rest.</p>
            <p>Only after that, I’ll return to my projects, my missions, and my dreams.</p>
            <p>One of them? Becoming a <span class="highlight">civil servant</span> — because I want to serve, protect, and bring softness to the systems we call home.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>☕ A Day in My Life</h2>
            <p>A perfect day? I’m still waiting for it.</p>
            <p>But for now, here’s my reality — and honestly, it’s beautiful too:</p>
            <p>A full day of studying, learning, teaching, commuting, and returning home exhausted — but proud.</p>
            <p>Late at night, I unwind with soft music, quiet screens, and sometimes, silent tears of both tiredness and gratitude. Because I know… I'm building something.</p>
            <p><strong>Something big. Something just mine. Something for her.</strong></p>

            <p>If you’ve read this far — thank you. I hope my story makes you feel something.</p>
            <p>And maybe… just maybe… you’ll remember the quiet girl from Matiari who refused to give up. 💖</p>
